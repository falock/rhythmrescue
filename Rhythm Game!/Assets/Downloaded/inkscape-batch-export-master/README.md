#inkscape-batch-export
Inkscape extensions to ease the process of batch exporting to PNG and SVG files.
Warning: SVG batch export is still experimental and does not handle SVG view zone correctly.

Installation:
Copy files to your Inkscape extenstions directory 
( ~/.config/inkscape/extensions under Linux; C:\Users\user\AppData\Roaming\inkscape\extensions under Windows );
Restart your Inkscape and you should see new options under Extensions->Export group.
